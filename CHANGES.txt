CAESAR -- CHANGES


#### 0.3.2 (2009-03-04) ###############################

* FIX: Added file and line info for eval code (better debugging).
* CHANGE: The top level DSL method names are now determined by
          by the class name. Some::ClassName becomes classname. 
          This is less confusing than allowing it to be anything
          and makes it possible to use several DSLs in the same
          namespace. 


#### 0.3.1 (2009-03-04) ###############################

* NEW: Accept instances without a name
* CHANGE: Updated examples. 
* NEW: More rdocs. 


#### 0.3 (2009-03-04) ###############################
