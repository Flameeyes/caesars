#### 0.4.2 (2009-03-05) ###############################

* FIX: missing bin/party.conf in gem release
* FIX: Now works with Ruby 1.8+
* NEW: Cleaner rdocs. 
* TODO: Fix support for top level methods with names:
food :extra do; end; # => food_extra


#### 0.4.0 (2009-03-05) ###############################

* CHANGE: Removed bloody method. We now parse blocks immediately.
* CHANGE: Renamed virgin method to chill.
* NEW: Caesar::Config class for loading DSLs as config files. 
See Example 3. 
* NEW: Added find_deferred method to automatically jump up the
heirarchy when looking for a specific attribute. 
* NEW: Added to_hash and [] methods to Caesar::Glass to make it 
more hashlike. 
* FIX: "chilled" attributes weren't available by method name


#### 0.3.2 (2009-03-04) ###############################

* FIX: Added file and line info for eval code (better debugging).
* CHANGE: The top level DSL method names are now determined by
by the class name. Some::ClassName becomes classname. 
This is less confusing than allowing it to be anything
and makes it possible to use several DSLs in the same
namespace.
