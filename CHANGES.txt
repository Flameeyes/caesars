#### 0.4.0 (2009-03-05) ###############################

* CHANGE: Removed bloody method. We now parse blocks immediately.

heirarchy when looking for a specific attribute.

more hashlike.

by the class name. Some::ClassName becomes classname.

and makes it possible to use several DSLs in the same
namespace.
